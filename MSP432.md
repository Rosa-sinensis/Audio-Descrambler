## MSP432

MSP432 board is used to perform the digital electronics part of the circuit.
The high-frequency crystal (HFXT) is set up at 48MHz, and the master clock MCLK is initialized to HFXT, meaning it will run at 48MHz 
P5.6 and P5.7 of the board are set to output the ADC reference voltage, and this voltage is used as the Vref in the Bias Circuit.
P2.0 to P2.7 are also set as output as these pins will be used to output the processed signal from MSP432.

On top of that, the code sets up the timer SysTick count to 960 clock cycles, meaning an interrupt will be generated 
50000 times a second since the clock is set to 48MHz. All the digital filtering functions need to be executed in the SysTick_Handler function,
meaning that all the functions need to be finished technically within a time of 1/48x10^6 s. 
You can also measure thow long it takes for SysTick_Handler to complete all the codes within the function by measuring the signal at P6.0

The main function of MSP432 is to perform:

### 1.Analog-to-Digital Conversion
Since the MSP432 is equipped with precision ADC, we can utilise its functionality by using ADC14 module in the MSP432 DriverLib. 
The type of ADC implemented in this board is called Successive Approximation Register (SAR).
This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0CGtr4SC9s provides a great introduction of how SAR ADC works.

### 2.Digital Filtering

The main purpose of digital filter is to filter the 8kHz noise from the audio signal. The filter implemented is a four order Chebyshev Type II filter since it is consists of two cascaded biquad sections.
From https://dspguru.com/dsp/howtos/implement-iir-filters/, the reason IIR filter is implemented in cascaded biquad forms is because "it provides a simple,
uniform building block that can be used to implement any IIR filter. This simplicity results in a more efficient filter, and easier to implement, 
and most importantly, in relative insensitivity to coefficient quantization, which is a highly desirable numerical property in the context of non-ideal computer arithmetic.".

The filter implemented can also be categorized as Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, since its current output depends on current and previous inputs and previous outputs.
The coefficients for implementing this filter is found by using MATLAB filterDesigner program.

### 3.Multiplication of sine wave
Next, the signal needs to be multiplied by 7kHz to simulate the flipping of frequency spectrum at 3.5kHz. To create a sin wave with a 7kHz signal, it can be a bit tricky because the SysTick_Handler interrupt is called every 20us. 
If we construct a sine wave by describing one complete cycle of sine wave with 20 points, our sine wave will be of frequency 2500kHz ( 1/(20 * 20us)).

To achieve a sine wave of frequency 7kHz, we need to describe one complete cycle using 7.14285 points ((1/7000kHz) / 20us), which is not an integer. Hence, the trick is instead of describing the sine wave with one complete cycle, we describe the sine wave with 7 complete cycles. 
This results in a total time of 1ms (1/7kHz * 7) which is divisible by 20us. 

One thing to note, from trigonometric identity:
 
      sin(a) * sin(b) = 1/2(cos(a-b) - cos(a+b))

Multiplication by sine wave two signals, the original signal, and unwanted upper sideband signal, which will be filtered later on using external lowpass filter circuit
